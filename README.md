## Overview

The vast availability of fast-food could lead to compromised health due to cheap prices. This paper analyses food nutrition and estimates the calories in McDonaldâ€™s menu items using a linear model. It is found that these values are close to what the company claims. This accuracy can help customers make informed decisions about their health.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from USDA and MenuStat.org.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT3.5. The entire transcript with the chatbox can be found here: other/llm/[filename].txt (there are multiple files).
