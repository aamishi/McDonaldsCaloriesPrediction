I have a dataset in R that has an id for a food and this id is repeated across several rows for different nutritional values of interest. How do i reshape the dataframe so that each row is the id for a food item and has the nutrional values under headers

You can use the pivot_wider() function from the tidyr package in R to reshape your dataframe. Assuming your dataframe is called df, and it has columns for food id, nutritional values, and possibly other columns, you can use pivot_wider() to pivot the data into a wider format where each row represents a unique food id and the nutritional values are spread across columns.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install and load the tidyverse package if you haven't already:
R
Copy code
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
Use the pivot_wider() function:
R
Copy code
df_wide <- df %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = food_id,  # Column containing food id
    names_from = nutritional_values,  # Column containing nutritional values
    values_from = value_of_nutritional_values  # Column containing corresponding values
  )
Replace food_id, nutritional_values, and value_of_nutritional_values with the actual column names in your dataframe.

This will reshape your dataframe so that each row represents a unique food id and the nutritional values are spread across columns.
